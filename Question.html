        <p>The market of household robots – aka in house, home, domestic,
           personal, or service robots – is increasingly expending. Popular
           WowWee Rovio, vacuum cleaner Roomba, Erector Spykee, and Anky Vector
           are good examples. But as they are introduced in houses, legal issues
           arise. Household robots are, by definition, equipped to collect data
           and process them to act in the world. This imply they have a large
           array of sensors, allowing them to operate but also to record
           personal data.</p>
        <p>Data collection seems to be necessary for the robot to properly
          function, but it also gives rise to privacy concern which, if left
          unsolved, can weaken consumers’ trust in market. Students who will
          choose this theme will <strong>identify all relevant legal, ethical, and
          technical issues, as well as their solutions</strong>. More precisely, they
          will have to <strong>identify trade-offs between privacy, efficiency, and
          trust</strong>. They should pay special attention to key requirements written
          by the European Commission’s High-Level Experts Group, especially
          “privacy and data governance” and “technical robustness and safety.
          ” The following non- exhaustive list of questions should help students
           in their work:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Technical aspects</li>
              <ol type = "A">
                <li> <a href="componentsOfhouseholdRobots.html">What are the main features and components of household robots?</a> </li>
                <li> Why and how do household robots collect data? </li>
                <li> What data is likely to be collected? </li>
                <li> Is data backup up and stored? If so, where, how, and how long? </li>
                <li> Is there a risk of hacking? By whom, how, and for what?
                  Can you (i) consider different 2. Legal cases of hijacking household robots and (ii) explain their harmful consequences? </li>
              </ol>
            <li>Legal aspects</li>
              <ol type = "A">
                  <li> What are the legal issues raised by household robots? </li>
                  <li> What are the fundamental rights at stake? </li>
                  <li> What are the current relevant legal instruments framing household robots? </li>
                  <li> How is data collection organized in EU law? Does the current framework fits challenges
                        raised by household robots? </li>
                  <li> What should be done in case of hacking? </li>
              </ol>
            <li>Interdisciplinary questions </li>
              <p>Could you envision trade-offs between use and protection of
                data? Could privacy-by-design and security-by-design be
                envisioned as workable solutions to protect users against
                hijacking of household robots? How is it possible to manage
                liability? What is the impact on liability if the transparency
                requirement is not met by the AI system? </p>
              <p>As stated above, this list is not exhaustive. It only aims to
                 help students structure their written report and online
                 presentation. They are free – and even encouraged – to identify
                  and answer other relevant questions. Furthermore, students
                  from Law and Applied Science Faculties should collaborate, in
                  order to present altogether technical and legal issues, as
                  well as their solutions
              </p>
          </ul>
